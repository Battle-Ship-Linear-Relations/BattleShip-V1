# BattleShip-V1
This is the first version of the battleship game

Possible Ideas:
make the size of the game adjustable
make the imput method with slopes
make the input method with inequalities
add a give up button
create a better solution for the play again method


Known Bugs:
the ship dissapears when you rotate the ship and becomes visible when you move the mouse to a different location
the computer might be able to cross over its own ships (might be fixed, we dont know for sure)
it does not display what coordinate the computer plays
The Jframe is destroyed and a new JFrame is created when you play again
The grid may not be properly alligned with the board
